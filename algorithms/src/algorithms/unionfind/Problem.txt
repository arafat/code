/**
 * Problem Description:
 * Union-Find algorithm is comprise of 2 parts Union and Find.
 * Given a set of nodes Union defines the operation of making a connection
 * between 2 nodes in the set e.g. Union(4, 9) will make a connection between
 * node labled as 4 and 9.
 * Find operation on the other hand is respnsible for checking if there is
 * a connection between 2 nodes e.g. Find(4, 9) will check if 4 and 9 are
 * connected or not.
